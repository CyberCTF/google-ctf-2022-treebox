The vendored folder is that commit's challenge folder, unchanged, without its Git history. The flag
is upstream's own (the `flag` file the Dockerfile copies into the chroot).

`app/challenge/Dockerfile` (the challenge's own, kCTF style) builds the machine as is: `docker: { build: app/challenge }`. Its base images are pinned by tag or digest.

To update, replace the vendored folder with a newer google-ctf commit, then change this file.
